Which means, first, why static web pages?

Because it matches better with static content -- less JS bloat, faster loading times, easier to add and deploy content, less temptation to feature creep and more street cred. Also, you can just leverage GitHub to handle article history.

Why Zola in particular? It had the most seductive documentation, I liked the name and the association with Rust did not hurt. 

Three cheers for the peeps at [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).
