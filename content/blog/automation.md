I don't think it is unfair to remark that there exists, presently, a generalized and atavistic way to look at the progress of automation and how it has and will affect the labour market, particularly the area it has a greater impact
on.

Part of the issue is that people are dawned into the big and obvious semantic signifiers like humanoid robots and large mechanical arms in assembly lines when they envision what automation must look like, leading them predicting the end of manual or low-paid service jobs, to be replaced by an army of bipedal androids or something similar, while retaining the office (white-collar) jobs as a somewhat safe bet. But the word automation should also bring to bear a security camera with an image recognition algorithm behind it, a payroll processing software, an Excel spreadsheet, a stock-trading virtual bot, etc... In many ways those jobs are not safe at all; worse still, they may be even in more jeopardy than others.

The notion of "easy to automate physical task" versus a "hard to automate mental task" is, I believe, somewhat misguided. It is actually easier to replace pure symbolic analysis tasks than any physical ones: the cost of a physical actuator will probably be greater than the cost of CPU cycles (which trends towards the dirt cheap specially with charge on-use only policies provided by cloud computing providers). The costs saved in automating a paper-pushing office job is also greater than the one saved by automating someone who is stacking shelves at the local supermarket, making it more of a priority for firms.

So is the range of automation. This is also due to a failure of imagination: one imagines that the only possible way to automate a job is to find a machine that can do the exact job as it exists -- imagining that a robot doctor must also walk around with a white coat and a stethoscope -- whereas in reality machines and software that greatly increase the capacity of a single person while displacing ten times more. I expected it to be quite difficult to automate all the doctors or all the  lawyers in the world but it may prove to be relatively easy to automate 80% to 90% of all doctors and lawyers.

Several fields are already evolving towards a type of winner-take all market to them -- think pop-stars or chefs -- and most professional employment will follow them if the trend holds. Google will still have software engineers, but it may have only 10 super productive ones taking 1 million USD in TC, leveraging all sorts of software-generating ML/AI solutions instead of 100 taking 200k. Spin up an instance on AWS that runs the work of a small battalion of big law firm clerks and the top attorneys can handle even big mergers without needing to hire more people. Cheap CPU power allied with Deep Learning models can quickly become economically more viable that high wages for highly specialized work.

Further still, all the demand for services that is created by the office works running around urban downtown's all day will fall, given that there will be less office workers to demand them, tanking low skilled service jobs with them.

It might be that slightly skilled manual labor will be the last job class to be wiped out. 

What remains? Ownership, of course. The only hedge against automation is CAPITAL OWNERSHIP i.e. owning the companies that have their productivity skyrocket. Seek equity, not cash.

It's way better to be the guy paying some other guy to automate a million jobs than to be the guy being payed to automate the jobs. Because eventually, his time will come too.
